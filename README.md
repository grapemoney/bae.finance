# bae.finance
Bae.finance | A new kind of BAE. 

-

Just like our Bae, $BAE is indivisible.

No dev wallets, no airdrop, no early wallets. Supply is 100% owned by the community.

A silly name, although cute, which stands for a desire : give the DeFi community a token they fully own.

20,000 BAE were minted and will be fairly released through bounce.finance on launch date.
